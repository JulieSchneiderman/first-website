					<p>This past summer I spent three and a half months working at a relatively small company. 
					Their focus is on gift and loyalty programs and they provide their clients with a wealth of 
					information about the clients' consumer base. Until a few months ago I didn't really understand why 
					everywhere I went I was being asked my name and email. Each time I went shopping and was asked for this 
					information I would let out a sigh, mostly because my name is so long and hard to spell. It got to the point
					where I would just give my drivers license.. But, after listening to the sales guy pitch our product three or four
					times a day for an entire summer, the value of information finally clicked. </p>

					<p>Before I ramble on about all the tech industry lessons I learned this summer, I want to spend some time on the business world in general.
					Each of my previous summer jobs weren't the type of jobs to boost my resume as fun and stress-free as they were. After finishing my second 
					year of a competitive computer science program I felt it was time to test the waters of what I call the "real world." The office was loft style
					with conference rooms named after candies, a movie theatre popcorn machine and one of those giant pac-man games you would see in arcades. Walking
					in on my first day and seeing all this did put me at ease, not going to lie. The environment was inviting and so were the twenty some-odd people 
					who came to introduce themselves to me. I immediately felt at ease. Now, let's jump forward a couple of weeks to my first planning meeting. The dev 
					team met up in the conference room with the VP of Project Management to discuss the upcoming features. She would explain the specific feature and then
					the dev team would discuss if it's a feasible option, and the cost to do it by breaking down the big task into several small ones and then estimating 
					the time of each of those tasks. From there the PM would decide on a plan of action. It was really cool to see how something went from a clients request, 
					to management discussing if it was worth their time, to the dev team laying out the cost, to the actual implementation of the feature. And what was really
					great was how the company dealt with problems. Perhaps I'm being naive but it all seemed so calm, cool and collected and that was something that I admired.
					I never really had any interest in the business world but now I'm intrigued and excited for any and all future endeavours. </p>

					<p>Alright, time for some life lessons told by a 21 year old comp sci student. This job focussed around databases which meant a lot of PHP and SQL.
					Thankfully I had taken a web development course and had a good knowledge base going in or else I one hundred percent would have been fed to the fishes. 
					I started off pair programming in order to better understand to app and the manor in which the programmers work. Then I was gradually given more and more
					individual tasks and one day I was even asked to write a full script from scratch. I remember being called into my boss’ office and him telling me that 
					today was the day I was going to start working on my own. Truthfully, I think my throat closed up from a minor moment of panic. It all felt very real. And 
					then some how I finished the task in half the amount of time than the dev team estimated and I immediately became the talk of the town. It felt pretty cool 
					to see a change I did implemented onto the web app and to surreal have the both the CEO and COO congratulating me on a job well done. Unfortunately, this is
					also where the self-doubt began to set in. To me, that task was easy so I felt like I didn't deserve the amount of praise I was given. My next struggle was
					the fact that I was always comparing myself to my teammates, each of whom had anywhere from 10 to 25 years of backend web development experience. In my mind 
					asking questions would make them see me as weak and unqualified. I felt like they would question the management's hiring skills if I asked "dumb" questions.
					That really wasn't the case. They knew I was relatively new to coding and I think they embraced that. Looking back I think they saw more potential in me than 
					I saw in myself. There were times when I felt google did more work than I did and that left me feeling like an imposter. None the less, the team consistently 
					showed me unconditional support mixed in with the perfect amount of "we're on a deadline" kind of pressure. So even though my tasks may not exactly compare 
					to the difficulty of my teammates' tasks, that doesn't mean mine were any less important to the company’s overall success. I'm the type of person who needs 
					time to reflect and be able to see the value of things that may be blatantly obvious to the people around me. It may have taken me some time to realize my 
					abilities and too quit being so hard on myself but I'd rather be a little late to the party then never arrive there at all. All in all, my first job in the 
					tech industry can only be described as a major learning experience. I could not be more thankful for the opportunity I was given and the hope I now have for 
					my future. Working as a full stack developer let me see where I excel, where I want to focus my energy, and the aspects of both business and programming that
					I hope to never have to deal with again.  </p>

					<p>This school year I'm working with a Kingston/Queen's University based start-up called connectiv8 doing front-end development and TA-ing for one
					of my favorite first year courses, intro to cognitive science. Beyond school and work, I'm interested in spending time doing lynda.com courses 
					specifically on graphic design and SEO. I like to market myself as a Jill-of-all-Trades because it is the knowledge of all things beyond the classroom
					that makes you stand out as an individual. The possibilities for my future are endless, I'm just hoping to get one step closer to finding my true calling.</p>
